Don't Touch The Button
======================

Mobile game created by Erik Schumacher.

C#, Unity

The goal is to press anywhere on the screen where a button does NOT exist.  It starts out easy, but quickly gets harder and harder as the time to press and the amount of buttons increases.

Includes powerups that will appear, along with a high score system.
